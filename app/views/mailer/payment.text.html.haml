    %p Judging by our GIANT watch that includes days of the month as well as minutes and hours, it's the 15th. This means your LoveTax has been delivered. Please take a moment to feel great. We have a summary for you:
    
    - @pledges.each do |p|
      #{number_to_currency(p.amount)} to #{h(p.tax.name)}
      %br/

    %br/
    Total:
    = number_to_currency(@pledges.inject(0) { |sum,p| sum + p.amount })
    
    %p
      The page to manage your tax payments is at #{link_to "http://lovetax.us/account", "http://lovetax.us/account"}.
      You can press pause if you want to skip a month or more, or you can stop your payments permanently at any time.
    
    %p
      Don't forget to invite your friends, family, fans, and total strangers to contribute to your preferred taxes.
      If you get stuck or have feedback, email us at team@lovetax.us any time.
